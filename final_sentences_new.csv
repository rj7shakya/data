in this video i'm going to introduce you to some,in this video i'm going to introduce you to

are considered machine learning problems so first let me so i tried to write down a definition of machine learning,are considered machine learning problems so first let me so i tried to write down a definition of machine learning
so here's what i came up with,so here's what i came up with
inferring what is unknown unknowns from knowns,inferring what is unknowns from knowns
and so machine learning is i would consider it as a subfield of statistics and machine learning has a particular emphasis on algorithms as opposed to statistics more generally,and so machine learning is a subfield of statistics and machine learning has a particular emphasis on algorithms as opposed to statistics more generally
analytical forms for for expressions that you can apply,analytical forms for expressions that you can apply
so and then so that's algorithms inferring so i say inferring because to emphasize the statistical notion of inference and so machine learning uses that typically uses probability and statistics to do inference thank you and this is the canonical problem any type of machine learning problem but i can think of at least,so that's algorithms inferring so i say inferring because to emphasize the statistical notion of inference and so machine learning uses that typically uses probability and statistics to do inference thank you and this is the canonical problem any type of machine learning problem but i can think of at least
you're given some knowns for example you're given some examples,you're given some knowns for example you're given some examples
and you have to answer some question about that that data or maybe you're given a new example and you have to answer question about,and you have to answer some question about that data or maybe you're given a new example and you have to answer question about
the new example so that is a an attempt at least at a definition and now so i wrote down a list of of applications of machine learning so just to give you a sense so if this definition doesn't cut it maybe we can define it by example give you a sense of what machine learning is so here's a first example,the new example so that is an attempt at least at a definition and now so i wrote down a list of of applications of machine learning so just to give you a sense so if this definition doesn't cut it maybe we can define it by example give you a sense of what machine learning is so here's a first example
